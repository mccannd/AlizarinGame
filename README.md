This was my senior design project for Fall 2016 for UPenn's digital media design program. This is a Diablo-inspired dungeon crawler created in Unreal Engine 4. The main task was to create an art-directable level generator, and the gameplay is very simple. Development has paused since then. This repo will show off the highlights of the project.
